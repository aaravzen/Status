This is a Social Media site proof of concept. It's aimed to be

Bare

bones.

The use-case is maintaining an uncluttered, private solution to staying connected.

Minimalist, low-data, a way to unintrusively stay in contact with people. Other sites have a lot going on.

This is aimed at keeping track of the essentials, akin to a family fridge or a community bulletin board.



Ideas for functionality so far:
- Add friends
- Be able to post a status at any time, locked for the next 24 hours
- Potentially incorporate notifs? Daily/weekly email updates? (would need email)

Banned from addition (things that go against the vision of this product and interfere with its use case):
- Ability to discover new people - you can add anyone by username, they have to accept you as a friend to see and post statuses - but the purpose of this site is to be able to peer into the lives of those you do know to see brief, important status updates. The one possible exception to this is potentially a "share friends" option to connect
- Advertisements
- Doing anything external with user data (ie. selling it)


Data we would store:
- Account name
- User (provided) name or identification (max 256 chars)
- Last posted user status (max 256 chars? Image option? Color for background? Should be able to make it pretty, aesthetic. Add emotion? Potentially a )
- Last posted user timestamp (max 256 chars)
- Friends/banned list

Needs:
- User account creation (signup/login/etc)
- See statuses view
- Create status option (visibility into time limit on FE would be nice)
- Add friend option

Notes:
- Blocking is currently unnecessary - all data is only presented to friends - unfriending is equivalent to blocking (with edge cases around friend requests)
